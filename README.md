# My Backend Project

## Description

This is a backend project template designed to set up a clean and scalable structure for Node.js applications. It includes basic directories for organizing controllers, models, routes, middlewares, utilities, services, and configuration files. The template also includes basic setup files like `.gitignore`, `.env`, and a default `README.md`.

The project structure follows a modular approach, allowing easy scaling as your application grows.

## Project Structure

The project is organized in the following structure:

### Folders:

- **public/**: Static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **src/**: Core application code.
  - **controllers/**: Logic to handle requests and return responses.
  - **models/**: Database models or data schema definitions.
  - **routes/**: Defines routes and links them with controllers.
  - **middlewares/**: Code to handle HTTP request/response cycles, like authentication or logging.
  - **utils/**: Helper functions that can be used across the app.
  - **config/**: Configuration files for the app (e.g., database, server settings).
  - **services/**: External services and APIs the app interacts with.
- **tests/**: Directory to write unit and integration tests for the app.

### Files:

- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in version control (e.g., `node_modules/`, `.env`, etc.).
- **.env**: Placeholder for environment variables, like database configuration (DB name, DB port, DB password).
- **README.md**: This file, describing the project setup and structure.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (or copy the structure if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/rabby-shek/nodejs-setup-plugin.git>

2. **copy the create-structure.js file and paste it in where you want to create the project** :

   ```bash
   ctrl + v 
   ctrl + c 

3. **Run command in the terminal for creating the project structure** 

   ```bash
   node create-structure your-project-name
